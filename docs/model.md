# **Data Model**

The key tables are the following:

- attributes  
- domains  
- controls  
- measures  
- documents  
- risks  

> **Roles:** `controls` = **security measures** (requirements to implement).  
> `measures` = **audit instances** (periodic verifications of those requirements).  
> `risks` = **information security risks** (ISO 27001 §6.1.2 register).

## **Table Dependencies**

```

The relationships are as follows:

| Link | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `domains` → `controls` | Foreign key (1:N) | Each security measure references its domain via `domain_id` |
| `controls` ↔ `measures` | Many-to-many (bidirectional) | Each security measure lists its audit instances in `measures[]`; each audit instance lists its security measures in `controls[]` |
| `attributes` → `controls` | Optional | The `attributes` field of a security measure may contain a list of attribute IDs |
| `attributes` → `measures` | Optional | Same for audit instances |
| `measures` → `measures` | Self-reference via `next_id` | Allows chaining successive campaigns of the same audit |
| `documents` → `measures` | Optional (1:N) | Documents and evidence are attached to audit instances via `measure_id` |
| `risks` ↔ `controls` | Many-to-many via `control_risk` | A mitigated risk must be linked to one or more security controls; the list is stored in `controls[]` on the risk |
| `users` → `risks` | Optional (1:N) | Each risk can be assigned an owner (`owner_id`) responsible for the periodic review |

> **Note:** There is no exposed join table for the controls/measures relationship.  
> IDs are directly embedded in each object on both sides.  
> The `control_risk` pivot table links risks to security controls.

## **attributes**

Attributes are multi-value classification reference sets.  
Each attribute defines a set of tags (prefixed with `#`) that can be associated with security measures and audit instances.

## **risks**

The risk register records information security risks in accordance with ISO 27001:2022 §6.1.2 and §8.2.  
Each risk is assessed using a configurable scoring method, optionally assigned to an owner, and subject to a periodic review cycle.  
A risk with *Mitigated* status must be linked to at least one security control via the `control_risk` pivot table.

### **Values of the `status` field**

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `not_evaluated` | Not yet assessed |
| `not_accepted` | Not accepted — a linked action plan is required |
